<p><small>The declension is unstable and should be treated as a guide. The case system was gradually being simplified from four to two cases. Even some nominative markers were sporadically kept in the Scanian dialect, although they mostly were replaced with the accusative endings from Old Norse.</small>

<ul><li>Using the word <i>land</i> is the most common way to form country names. This can be done in one of two ways:
<ul><li>Prefixing the name of a people to the word <i>land</i>. Ex: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Franca#Old_English" title="Franca">Franca</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">French person</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> → <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Francland#Old_English" title="Francland">Francland</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">France</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Sweon#Old_English" title="Sweon">Swēo</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Swede</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> → <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Sweoland#Old_English" title="Sweoland">Swēoland</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Sweden</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, and <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction:Old_English/Unger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Reconstruction:Old English/Unger (page does not exist)">&#42;Unger</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">a Hungarian</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> → <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Ungerland#Old_English" title="Ungerland">Ungerland</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Hungary</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>.</li>
<li>Prefacing <i>land</i> with the genitive plural form of a people, producing the literal meaning “land of ____ people.” Ex: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Egypta_land#Old_English" title="Egypta land">Egypta land</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Egypt</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span>, literally <span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">land of the Egyptians</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Sigelhearwena_land#Old_English" title="Sigelhearwena land">Siġelhearwena land</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Ethiopia</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span>, literally <span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">land of the Ethiopians</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>.</li></ul></li>
<li>However, country names can also be formed other ways. For instance, words other than <i>land</i> are used: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Dene#Old_English" title="Dene">Dene</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">a Dane</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> → <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Denemearc#Old_English" title="Denemearc">Denemearc</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Denmark</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span>, literally <span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Dane borderland</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>. It is also very common to use the name of a people for the country they inhabit: <i>On þām dagum wæs Alexander ġeboren on <u>Crēcum</u> swā swā miċel ȳst cōme ofer ealne middanġeard</i> (“In those days, Alexander was born in <u>Greece</u> [lit. <i>in the Greeks</i>] like a great storm coming over the whole world”), <i>Ymb twā ġēar þæs þe hē cōm of <u>Francum</u>, hē ġefōr</i> (”Two years after he came from <u>France</u> [lit. <i>from the Franks</i>], he died”). In addition, country names are sometimes loaned directly from Latin: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Arabia#Old_English" title="Arabia">Arabia</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Israhel#Old_English" title="Israhel">Isrāhēl</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Italia#Old_English" title="Italia">Italia</a></i>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Syria#Old_English" title="Syria">Syria</a></i>. Finally, some country names are simply idiomatic: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/Nor%C3%BEweg#Old_English" title="Norþweg">Norþweġ</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">Norway</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span>, literally <span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">north way</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>.</li>
<li>Unlike most words, <i>land</i> undergoes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i-umlaut" class="extiw" title="w:i-umlaut">i-umlaut</a> when combined with the suffix <i class="Latn mention nowrap" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/-isc#Old_English" title="-isc">-isċ</a></i>: <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/inlendisc#Old_English" title="inlendisc">inlendisċ</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">native</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="ang"><a href="/wiki/uplendisc#Old_English" title="uplendisc">uplendisċ</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">rural</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>.</li></ul>
